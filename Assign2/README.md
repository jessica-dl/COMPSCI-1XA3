# Assignment 2: Resume and Game in ELM

Due on March 25th, 2018.

## Resume

   - If you would like to view my resume, click [here](http://ugweb.cas.mcmaster.ca/~deleeuwj).
       - It is a modified version of the CV template created by [Xiaoying Riley](https://github.com/xriley/Orbit-Theme).
       - I removed the original profile container and added a header with an image on it. I also added multiple sections and fixed the icons for each of the sections.  

## ELM Web App

   - You are a circle in a rectangular world. Try your best to escape! Get to the end to get out.
      - If you would like to play it, you can find it through my resume, under the Projects section.
      - A blue rectangle shows the area that the circle is allowed to travel within; this is for users on larger screens.
   - `valInList` function is a modified version of the `helper` function found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33625335/how-to-get-the-first-index-of-a-given-element-in-array-list-in-elm).
